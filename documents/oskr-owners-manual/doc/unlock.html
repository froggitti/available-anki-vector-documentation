<section id="step-2-doing-a-test-upgrade">
<h2>Step 2: Doing a Test Upgrade<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-doing-a-test-upgrade" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that you do a test upgrade with a safe
upgrade file before unlocking your robot. If the process is confusing
the first time it’s recommended you do a test upgrade again and again
until you feel comfortable with the process.</p>
<p>Remember that modifying the ABOOT and recovery filesystems are
dangerous operations. If the process is interrupted somehow while
system files are installing it will make it impossible to boot
Vector. Some potential points of failure in a normal OTA upgrade are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Vector loses power in the middle of the upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p>Your wifi modem breaks or is unplugged in the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Your service providers connection dies in the middle of the OTA file download.</p></li>
<li><p>Some random part of the internet has issues preventing the OTA from<br />downloading completely.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn’t matter for normal OTA installs because the process is
designed to be safe and we can always fall back to the recovery
software. But when unlocking we are <strong>REWRITING</strong> the recovery
software. An interruption like this can be
disastrous.</p>
<p>To minimize chances of network problems interfering with the update
process the recommended procedure is serve your unlock image from your
computer to Vector locally. This eliminates any possibility of Wide
Area Network issues affecting the outcome.</p>
<p>The process is not particularly complex if you follow the steps as
written but it can be confusing the first time you do it, particularly
if you don’t have much experience with networking. Luckily you can
practice by uploading a normal system upgrade manually. This is <em>safe</em>
and can be repeated safely.</p>
<section id="hosting-the-ota-locally">
<h3>Hosting the OTA locally<a class="headerlink" href="#hosting-the-ota-locally" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We need to host the OTA locally on your computer we’re using to update
since there will be no access to anything else at that point in time.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download a local copy of the latest production firmware from
<a class="reference external" href="http://vectorfirmware.ddlbot.ai/vicos/vicos-2.0.1.6081.ota">http://vectorfirmware.ddlbot.ai/vicos/vicos-2.0.1.6081.ota</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a simple webserver to serve up the files. Here we use
python because it is installed on many systems and has a
lightweight webserver built in. However there is nothing special
about python here so you may substitute with a webserver you’re
more familiar with</p>
<p>Assuming you saved the file in a Downloads folder:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">~/</span><span class="n">Downloads</span> <span class="c1"># or other directory</span>
<span class="n">python3</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or if you don’t have python3 installed:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">~/</span><span class="n">Downloads</span> <span class="c1"># or other directory</span>
<span class="n">python</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">SimpleHTTPServer</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Determine the LAN IP of your computer. This is different from the
external address and will generally start with 192.168, or 10.0. If<br />you don’t know how to find the address
<a class="reference external" href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-find-your-local-and-external-ip-address-5833108">this LifeHacker article</a> might help.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the Chrome Browser and verify that you can get to the file. If
your computer’s IP address is 192.168.1.130, the link is
<a class="reference external" href="http://192.168.1.130:8000/">http://192.168.1.130:8000/</a></p>
<p>You should see a basic index page listing files including latest.ota.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/directory-listing.png" src="../_images/directory-listing.png" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">latest.ota</span></code> file and verify that the link works and
your browser asks you to download the file.</p></li>

<h3>Prepping the robot<a class="headerlink" href="#prepping-the-robot" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>First, fully charge your Vector. Keep him on the charging dock. Next
wipe the user data from Vector and enter into Recovery Mode.</p>
<section id="erasing-user-data">
<h4>Erasing User Data<a class="headerlink" href="#erasing-user-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>First wipe the user data from Vector. This will erase the entire contents of
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/data</span></code> partition. It will also give the Vector a new identity and name later.</p>
<p>To do so:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Place Vector on its charging station.</p></li>
<li><p>Press his backpack button twice. The normal BLE Pairing screen
should appear on its screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Lift Vector’s forklift up and down. A administration menu should
appear on its screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove Vector from its charging station and spin one of the tank
treads. This will move the <strong>&gt;</strong> arrow pointing at an option.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <strong>CLEAR USER DATA</strong>. Lift the forklift up and down to
proceed. A confirmation screen should appear.</p></li>
<li><p>Spin the tank treads to select <strong>CONFIRM</strong>. Lift the forklift up
and down. Vector should reboot and start at the initial setup screen.</p></li>
<li><p>You will now need to re-attach Vector to your account via the Phone
App or other means and re-download the newly generated SSH key if
you wish to SSH in to Vector.</p></li>

<h4>Recovery Mode (aka Factory Reset)<a class="headerlink" href="#recovery-mode-aka-factory-reset" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Next perform Recovery Mode reboot (Factory Reset) of your Vector.
This will cause Vector to reboot and run using the the initial factory recovery<br />filesystem.</p>
<p>To do so:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Place Vector on its charging station.</p></li>
<li><p>Hold its backpack button down until it powers down completely and<br />keep holding down until the white light at the back of the backpack<br />comes on.</p></li>

advanced options that aren’t available in the normal interface.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Open a new tab in Chrome and go to <a class="reference external" href="https://vector-setup.ddl.io">https://vector-setup.ddl.io</a></p></li>

</ol>
</section>
<section id="starting-the-deploy">
<h3>Starting the deploy<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-the-deploy" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is the critical step. We want to do this correctly.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Go back to your tab with the file directory listing. Since Vector
will be requesting the file <strong>DO NOT</strong> use links with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">localhost</span></code> in
them or it won’t be able to find the files.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the full link for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">latest.ota</span></code> to your clipboard.</p></li>

</ol>
<p>If all goes well you should see a status bar update, the file should
upload, Vector will reboot, and you’ll have the new version of the
firmware.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t go well you may get an error status code in the
window. Some of the more common status codes are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>203</strong> Vector couldn’t find the file. You either had the wrong
link, such as using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">localhost</span></code> or you don’t have a webserver running.</p></li>

<section id="step-3-installing-the-unlock-image">
<h2>Step 3: Installing the unlock image<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-installing-the-unlock-image" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the critical step. We want to do this correctly.</p>
<p>Now we follow the same procedure with the custom generated image for
your Vector. If you skipped ahead to here <em>please</em> go through the test
run with a safe file. Assuming you know what you’re doing:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start from an updated vector with updated software. The 0.9.0
recovery software does not support updating the appropriate
partitions and it will fail to try to install the unlock image.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, it does this safely and you will not damage your
Vector if you forget to do so.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Put a book or heavy block in front of Vector to keep him from driving
off the charging station while updating.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the link to the custom image provided by Digital Dream Labs
instead of the normal OTA file. Note that each custom image only
works on ONE Vector. If you have multiple Vectors each will need
its own image.  Vector’s face probably won’t show any indication
that an update is in process – he will show his eyes rather than
a cloud with a spinner.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After installation is complete Vector should reboot and you should now
see an introductory screen that says OSKR. This means that your
Vector is working and has the new security keys needed for OSKR
development.</p>
<p>We’re out of danger now.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Installing the latest OSKR image<a class="headerlink" href="#step-4-installing-the-latest-oskr-image" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Next we need to install an up-to-date software image to bring back all
the expected functionality. This is a <strong>safe</strong> update again. If there
are problems the Vector will continue to run. No need to be paranoid
on this update.</p>
<p>Get the file

apply it to Vector the same way you applied the test upgrade.
<strong>Please Note: This is NOT the same .ota file you downloaded earlier! Please download this new file and either rename it or store it elsewhere to differentiate the OSKR image from the production image you downloaded earlier.</strong></p>

<p>Now that Vector is up and running and back to his normal self you’ll
want to get the newly created SSH key. Although this isn’t strictly
part of the unlock process this key is needed to access Vector’s
internals and begin your OSKR adventure! So lets grab it now.</p>
<p>To get the QSN:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using the Chrome web browser go to <a class="reference external" href="https://vector-setup.ddl.io">https://vector-setup.ddl.io</a></p></li>
<li><p>Follow the instructions to pair with Vector and log in.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Download Logs</strong> link located at the top right corner of

<li><p>Open the downloaded archive which should extract the contents of
several logs on to your hard drive.</p></li>
<li><p>The file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data/ssh/id_rsa</span></code> is your security key. It<br />should be installed so it can be used by your system. On Linux and<br />OSX:</p>

<h2>Advanced Network Configuration: Enabling AP mode<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-network-configuration-enabling-ap-mode" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have a particularly bad router or wifi connection it’s best to
find a better connection to kick off the upgrade. However it is
possible to eliminate your router as a dependency and talk directly to
Vector by turning it in to an Access Point. The downside to this is
that you will lose all normal internet access and only be able to
talk to Vector until the process is complete.</p>
<p>This usually provides a better more reliable connection but some
computers’ network cards may have more trouble than not connecting to
Vector’s 2.4 Ghz network. Once again it is <strong>strongly recommended</strong>
that you test an AP style deploy with the safe upgrade image as listed
in Step 2 above.</p>
<p>Follow the process until bring up the simulated command terminal. From
there:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Issue the command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wifi-ap</span> <span class="pre">true</span></code>. This will display new credentials
for the new wifi connection.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[v5] P7Z4$
wifi-ap true
         ssid: Vector P7Z4
   password: 20809135
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Connect your computer to this access point with this password.</p></li>
<li><p>Test that you can access the file index at
<a class="reference external" href="http://192.168.0.2:8000">http://192.168.0.2:8000</a> which will be your new Local IP while
connected to Vector.</p></li>
<li><p>Resume the existing process while still on the access point.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If all goes well Vector will install and reboot, and your computer
will automatically go back to its normal network.</p>
